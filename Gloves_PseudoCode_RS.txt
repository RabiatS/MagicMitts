// Initialization
START 
    SETUP ESP32 microcontroller
    SETUP Power Pack (Dual 3.7V Battery Cells with Boost Converters)
    INITIALIZE all 5 flex sensors connected to ESP32 GPIO
    INITIALIZE electromagnetic braking system with boost converters and MOSFETs
    SETUP Serial Communication between ESP32 and Unity
    INITIALIZE all finger joint transforms in Unity
    INITIALIZE interactable objects in Unity with appropriate colliders

// Main Control Loop in ESP32
LOOP ESP32
    READ values from all 5 flex sensors (Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky)
    MAP sensor values to bending angles for each finger
    SEND mapped angles to Unity via Serial in CSV format
    CHECK for incoming commands from Unity:
        IF command == "BRAKE":
            ACTIVATE corresponding electromagnetic brake
        ELSE IF command == "RELEASE":
            DEACTIVATE all electromagnetic brakes
        END IF

// Unity Main Loop
LOOP Unity
    READ sensor values from ESP32
    PARSE CSV data into individual finger joint angles

    // Apply Finger Movements
    FOR each finger (Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky)
        APPLY rotation to each joint (Knuckle, Middle, Tip) based on sensor data
    END FOR

    // Check for Object Interactions
    FOR each interactable object
        IF hand collides with object
            SEND "BRAKE" command to ESP32 to activate the specific electromagnetic brake
        ELSE IF hand moves away from the object
            SEND "RELEASE" command to ESP32 to deactivate the brake
        END IF
    END FOR
END LOOP

// Electromagnetic Braking System Controlled by ESP32
IF "BRAKE" command received
    ACTIVATE corresponding electromagnet via GPIO
    CONTROL MOSFETs to drive current through the electromagnets using boost converters
    WAIT for specific duration or until command is "RELEASE"
    MAINTAIN braking force if contact is sustained
END IF

IF "RELEASE" command received
    DEACTIVATE all electromagnets
    TURN OFF boost converters to minimize power consumption
END IF

// Clean Up on Exit
ON EXIT
    CLOSE serial ports on ESP32 and Unity
    DEACTIVATE all electromagnetic braking systems
    POWER DOWN boost converters

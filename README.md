The Smart VR Glove is an affordable innovation in virtual reality technology that offers users an immersive and realistic experience across standard VR systems.
It utilizes a novel electromagnetic braking system and haptic actuators to provide precise tactile feedback, simulating the sensation of touch and grasp in the virtual world. 
Enhanced by our own self-developed hardware driver, the gloveâ€™s flex-sensitive resistors offer superior finger-tracking accuracy.
This wireless, rechargeable battery-powered glove is designed to provide VR users with a more natural VR experience, setting a new benchmark for affordability, compatibility, and interactivity in virtual environments.

## Need for product 
Current virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are
currently devoid of an affordable, immersive accessory that offers
haptic feedback and finger pullback functionality, leading to less
engaging user experience marked by inadequate dexterity and
prevalent compatibility issues. The few comprehensive solutions
available, like those from HaptX, command prices upwards of
$4,000, placing them beyond the reach of a broader audience.
This significant cost barrier impedes the universal development
and adoption of deeply immersive and personalized VR/AR
experiences

The Smart VR Glove is an affordable innovation in virtual reality technology that offers users an immersive and realistic experience across standard VR systems.
It utilizes a novel electromagnetic braking system and haptic actuators to provide precise tactile feedback, simulating the sensation of touch and grasp in the virtual world. 
Enhanced by our own self-developed hardware driver, the gloveâ€™s flex-sensitive resistors offer superior finger-tracking accuracy.
This wireless, rechargeable battery-powered glove is designed to provide VR users with a more natural VR experience, setting a new benchmark for affordability, compatibility, and interactivity in virtual environments.
